📌 Project Title: VisionBox – Live Object Tracker
🔍 Overview:
VisionBox is a real-time object detection and tracking web application that uses a webcam feed to identify and highlight objects using bounding boxes. It combines computer vision and web technologies to create an interactive, responsive frontend for tracking live objects with labels and confidence scores.

🧠 Features:
Real-time object tracking using webcam
Object detection with YOLOv8 (or MobileNet SSD)
Bounding boxes with class labels and confidence
Frontend built with HTML, CSS (animated dark theme), and JavaScript
Backend built with Python Flask + OpenCV

🧰 Tech Stack:
Frontend: HTML, CSS (Grey & Black animated theme), JavaScript
Backend: Python (Flask), OpenCV, YOLOv8
Computer Vision: Ultralytics YOLO / MobileNet SSD
Others: Webcam Integration, Live Video Stream

🚀 How It Works:
Start the Flask server (python app.py)
Open the browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000
Click "Video Stream" to start live tracking from your webcam
Watch as bounding boxes appear on detected objects in real-time
